$tips.push "If you want to move a project to the someday/maybe list, you can't.\n\r  You can only delete the existing project and create a new task.\n\r  So, the only way to do it is to say 't sm <title of your project>'.\n\r  This is deliberate, to provide just enough friction to make sure it's worth deferring and thinking about later, instead of just completing/deleting."
