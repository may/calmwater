      Also note that I've used wordpress for years, and stil support clients doing it, and also tried:
      hugo
      jekyell
      ghost
      ec.
      etc.
      and wriet.as is still my reccommendation for 90% of cases
      the other 10% involving needing a CRM, billing, or something fancier than a blog.
