        Also note that I've used wordpress for years, and stil support clients doing it, and also tried:
        hugo
        jekyell
        ghost
        ec.
        etc.
        and wriet.as is still my reccommendation for 90% of cases
        the other 10% involving needing a CRM, billing, or something fancier than a blog.
